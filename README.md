# üëã Hello there! I'm Miguel

I'm a passionate junior front-end developer with a focus on creating engaging and functional user experiences. My background includes leading teams and contributing to both front-end and back-end development. I've worked with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js, implementing creative and efficient solutions.

My love for coding is complemented by my language skills, as I am fluent in both English and German. This enables me to effectively collaborate in international teams and understand the needs of a global audience. I'm committed to continuing my career growth as a front-end developer, constantly learning and staying up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies. I'm eager to contribute my expertise and skills to the development of innovative solutions that enhance the user experience and drive successful projects forward.
